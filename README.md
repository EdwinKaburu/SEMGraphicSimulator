# SEMGraphicSimulator
Simplified computer graphic simulation of the solar to earth moon system

## Objective
The goal of the project was to create a simplified solar system that showcases the Moon, Earth,
and the Sun. In this system both planets will be rotating around their own axis with the moon
orbiting around the Earth; Both Moon and Earth will be transformed to their respective scale. The other secondary objective involved, the planets having
textures, and bump mapped, the camera can move forward, backwards, left and right
directions. Finally, there is a night sky as the background.
Below is the original image sketch of the goal.
